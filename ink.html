<p> The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally
   titled as Krishna Līlā. He is a central figure in the Mahabharata,
    the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad
   Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological,
    and mythological texts.[19] They portray him in various perspectives: 
   as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and
     the universal supreme being.[20] His iconography reflects these legends
   and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating
   butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded
   by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.[21]</p>

   <h3>radha rani is love of Krishna</h3>
   <hr>
  <p> This tragic story is dear to devotees not only because 
    of the very real human feelings it evokes, but also because
     of its deep theological significance in the Vaishnava
      tradition – the Hindu tradition in which this story features
       most prominently.

     She was courageous and bold, she fell in love with Lord Krishna.
